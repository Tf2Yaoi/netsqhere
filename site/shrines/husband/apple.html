                Hello, my love. This is a special place for you. In the short amount of time that we've known each other, it feels like you've completely changed my life. I couldn't imagine it without you, I see my whole future with you. Ever since we started talking, you've been a complete sweetie to me. I don't know how I'm the one that managed to get you to myself, but I'm so grateful for that.
                <br>
                You're the most wonderful person I've ever met, and I can't wait to see how this goes. I have nothing but hope for us. As the title states, you are truly the apple of my eye. (cornball alert!) I really hope you know how much I care about you, and how much I love you. You don't know how lucky <span>I AM</span> to have you in my life, I feel like I've won the lottery.
                You make me so happy, more than you can ever know. I know I'm not the most non-chalant, so It's not like I hide my feelings for you, but I hope you know how happy you make me. I smile every time I see that you've texted me, I just get so excited. Like some sort of dog. 
                <br><br>
                You are genuinely such a sweetheart, and you deserve nothing but the best. I can't believe that a sweetie like you enjoys my presence, but I'm so glad that you do. I want to make you feel like the most special person in the world, because you are. You're my entire world. Once I get started with my service, I want to be able to give you everything you desire. 
                <br>
                I want to include you in everything I do. I want to be able to give you the world, you deserve nothing less.
                I'm happy to indulge you for the rest of my life, and I hope you know that. Whatever you enjoy, I want to enjoy it too so we can share it together. I couldn't ask for anything better than this.
                I have made many websites and pages, but this one is the most special to me. A love letter from me to you, and I hope you can feel the love I put into it. 
                <br><br>
                Now, onto the silly stuff. Aside from John and Javier, I see us in Hank and Connor from Detroit become human. I would've said Soldier and Demo, but that's too easy lol. You are really the light of my life right now, and you make things so much better. I will always be here for you, and love you so much more than you can imagine. It feels like I was destined to meet you, so I won't let anything ruin this. My stomach hurts even writing this righ now, becasue I just love you so much and want everything to go well for us. Does any of this even make any sense?? I feel like I'm just rambling.
